## Environmental filtering drives assembly of diatom communities over evolutionary timescales

This repository contains all data and R code to reproduce the statistical analysis of Jovanovska et al. on diatom assembly processes in Lake Ohrid. [Reproducible analysis](https://thauffe.github.io/OhridDiatomAssembly/Jovanovska.html)

The Rmarkdown script Jovanovska.Rmd uses parallel computation with up to 28 CPU cores. Adjust Ncores and Threads arguments according to your machine. Computational resources were provided by the de.NBI Cloud within the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).
